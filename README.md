## References
The used method for the fluid simulation is based on the paper ["Particle-based fluid simulation for interactive applications" from Mueller et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/846276.846298) from 2003.

The OpenGL related code is based on the [YouTube OpenGL-tutorial of The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) and on the lab-lessons of the "Real-Time Graphics Programming Course".
